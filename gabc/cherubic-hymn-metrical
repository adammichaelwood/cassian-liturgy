We who represent choired angels,
honorable cherubim,
praising God, the ever changeless,
casting all our care before Him,
Blessed Trinity, thrice-holy,
let us sing the thrice-holy hymn. 

Let us lay aside our worries,
welcoming the King of all,
Giver of all life, all mercies,
To whom unseen angels call:
Holy, thou art Holy, Holy,
Holy, Mighty, Immortal!
