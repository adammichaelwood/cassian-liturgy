v: 24-27

He rained down manna upon them to eat *
and gave them grain from heaven.

So mortals ate the bread of angels; *
he provided for them food enough.

He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens *
and led out the south wind by his might.

He rained down flesh upon them like dust *
and winged birds like the sand of the sea.

He let it fall in the midst of their camp *
and round about their dwellings.

So they ate and were well filled, *
for he gave them what they craved.
