O Lord my God, I take refuge in you; *
save and deliver me from all who pursue me;

Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces *
and snatch me away with none to deliver me.

O Lord my God, if I have done these things: *
if there is any wickedness in my hands,

If I have repaid my friend with evil, *
or plundered him who without cause is my enemy;

Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, *
trample my life into the ground,
and lay my honor in the dust.

Stand up, O Lord, in your wrath; *
rise up against the fury of my enemies.

Awake, O my God, decree justice; *
let the assembly of the peoples gather round you.

Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; *
O Lord, judge the nations.

Give judgment for me according to my righteousness, O Lord, *
and according to my innocence, O Most High.

Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,
but establish the righteous; *
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.

God is my shield and defense; *
he is the savior of the true in heart.

God is a righteous judge; *
God sits in judgment every day.

If they will not repent, God will whet his sword; *
he will bend his bow and make it ready.

He has prepared his weapons of death; *
he makes his arrows shafts of fire.

Look at those who are in labor with wickedness, *
who conceive evil, and give birth to a lie.

They dig a pit and make it deep *
and fall into the hole that they have made.

Their malice turns back upon their own head; *
their violence falls on their own scalp.

I will bear witness that the Lord is righteous; *
I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.

O Lord our Governor, *
how exalted is your Name in all the world!

Out of the mouths of infants and children *
your majesty is praised above the heavens.

You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *
to quell the enemy and the avenger.

When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,

What is man that you should be mindful of him? *
the son of man that you should seek him out?

You have made him but little lower than the angels; *
you adorn him with glory and honor;

You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *
you put all things under his feet:

All sheep and oxen, *
even the wild beasts of the field,

The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.

O Lord our Governor, *
how exalted is your Name in all the world!

I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with my whole heart; *
I will tell of all your marvelous works.

I will be glad and rejoice in you; *
I will sing to your Name, O Most High.

When my enemies are driven back, *
they will stumble and perish at your presence.

For you have maintained my right and my cause; *
you sit upon your throne judging right.

You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; *
you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.

As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, *
their cities ploughed under, the memory of them perished;

But the Lord is enthroned for ever; *
he has set up his throne for judgment.

It is he who rules the world with righteousness; *
he judges the peoples with equity.

The Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed, *
a refuge in time of trouble.

Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, *
for you never forsake those who seek you, O Lord.

Sing praise to the Lord who dwells in Zion; *
proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.

The Avenger of blood will remember them; *
he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.

Have pity on me, O Lord; *
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,
O you who lift me up from the gate of death;

So that I may tell of all your praises
and rejoice in your salvation *
in the gates of the city of Zion.

The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, *
and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.

The Lord is known by his acts of justice; *
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.

The wicked shall be given over to the grave, *
and also all the peoples that forget God.

For the needy shall not always be forgotten, *
and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.

Rise up, O Lord, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; *
let them be judged before you.

Put fear upon them, O Lord; *
let the ungodly know they are but mortal.
